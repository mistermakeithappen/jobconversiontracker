# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an AI-powered workflow automation platform - a Make.com competitor that uses natural language to generate complete workflows. The project consists of two main parts:

1. **Root directory**: Basic Supabase setup and REF MCP configuration
2. **workflow-automation/**: Main Next.js application with comprehensive automation features

## Key Commands

### Development
```bash
# Main application (run from workflow-automation/ directory)
npm run dev              # Start development server with Turbopack
npm run build           # Build for production
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run start           # Start production server

# Database operations
npm run setup-db        # Run database migrations  
npm run create-mock-user # Create mock user for development
npm run init-db         # Check database initialization status
```

### Testing
```bash
# No formal test framework configured yet
# Use manual testing via development server

# Debug/Development endpoints
npm run dev  # Then visit /developer for development tools
```

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.4, React 19, TypeScript, TailwindCSS 4, React Flow
- **Authentication**: Clerk (currently bypassed with mock auth for development)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with RLS)
- **Payments**: Stripe (configured but not active)

## Critical Development Context

### Authentication System (Important!)
- **Current State**: Using mock authentication for development
- **Mock User ID**: `af8ba507-b380-4da8-a1e2-23adee7497d5`
- **Files**: `lib/auth/mock-auth.tsx`, `lib/auth/mock-auth-server.ts`
- **Database Access**: Uses service role key to bypass RLS in API routes
- **TODO**: Replace with Clerk auth and update RLS policies

### Database Configuration
- **Supabase Project**: `hmulhwnftlsezkjuflxm`
- **RLS**: Enabled but bypassed via service role key in development
- **Key Tables**: users, workflows, executions, integrations, opportunity_receipts, time_entries, user_api_keys
- **Migration Pattern**: Extensive migration system (20+ files) - always run in order

### GoHighLevel Integration (Production-Ready)
- **OAuth 2.0**: Complete implementation with encrypted token storage
- **API Client**: `lib/integrations/gohighlevel/client.ts` with automatic token refresh
- **Restrictions**: Cannot use "ghl" or "highlevel" in OAuth redirect URLs
- **Endpoints**: All use `/api/integrations/automake/` prefix due to GHL restrictions
- **Features**: Contacts, opportunities with real-time data, receipt tracking, time tracking

### AI Receipt Processing System
- **BYOK Model**: Users provide their own OpenAI API keys
- **Vision API**: Extracts vendor, amount, date, description from receipt images
- **Job Matching**: Intelligent matching to GoHighLevel opportunities
- **File Support**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, HEIC, PDF with automatic PNG conversion
- **API**: `/api/receipts/process-image` for uploads, `/api/receipts/process-from-message` for SMS
- **Dependencies**: Sharp, pdf2pic for file conversion

## Development Patterns

### API Routes
- All use service role Supabase client: `getServiceSupabase()`
- Authentication via `mockAuthServer()` from `mock-auth-server.ts`
- Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes
- Integration-specific endpoints under `/api/integrations/`

### Database Operations
- Service role key bypasses RLS for development
- Extensive migration system - always run migrations in chronological order
- Foreign key constraints removed for mock auth compatibility
- Row-level security policies prepared for production auth

### Component Architecture
- Mock auth context provided by `MockAuthProvider`
- Supabase client operations through `lib/supabase/client.ts`
- React Flow for workflow visualization
- Comprehensive integration with GoHighLevel APIs

## Common Development Issues & Solutions

### Database Issues
- **Time Entries FK Constraint**: Remove foreign key to auth.users for mock auth
- **Missing Columns**: Run latest migrations for schema updates
- **RLS Bypass**: Use service role key in API routes during development

### GoHighLevel Integration
- **Pagination**: Use `startAfterId`, not `offset` for API pagination
- **URL Restrictions**: Cannot use "ghl" or "highlevel" in OAuth URLs
- **Token Refresh**: Automatic refresh 5 minutes before expiration

### File Processing
- **Receipt Processing**: Always convert to PNG before OpenAI Vision API using `FileConverter` utility
- **Large Files**: 10MB limit with proper validation
- **PDF Support**: First page only extraction for receipts via pdf2pic
- **Supported Formats**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, TIFF, HEIC, PDF

### API Key Management
- **Encryption**: AES-256-GCM for all stored API keys
- **BYOK Model**: Users provide their own OpenAI/Anthropic keys
- **Validation**: Real-time validation when adding new keys

## Deployment Notes
- **Target**: Vercel deployment
- **Database**: Supabase cloud (production ready)
- **Authentication**: Will need Clerk integration for production
- **File Storage**: Supabase storage for receipt images
- **Environment**: Configured for Vercel deployment

## Integration Status
- âœ… GoHighLevel OAuth 2.0 (production-ready)
- âœ… AI Receipt Processing with OpenAI Vision
- âœ… Time Tracking with Payment Structures
- âœ… Workflow Execution Engine
- âœ… React Flow Workflow Builder
- ðŸ”„ Clerk Authentication (mock auth currently)
- ðŸ”„ Stripe Billing (configured but inactive)
- ðŸ”„ Additional integrations (Notion, JotForm planned)
